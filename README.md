This repository is used to show evidence of the finalised MATLAB code for the Machine Vision (MV) implementation within the GIP completed by Damian Biel, Ben Boxer, Harry Jones, Edward Lunnon and Alexander Schumann.

.m files are attached showing the algorithm for the assemply plate and standards part inventory subsystems, along with camera calibration and test video example codes. Two example images are also attached for use.
